The full stack comes in at **EUR\xa0187.34/month** (November\xa02025) and is designed for small teams that need production reliability.\\n\\n## What you get in v1\\n\\n- **Core platform** \u2013 Automated Hetzner bootstrap, HA control plane access via HAProxy, and Rook-Ceph backed storage across three 200\u202fGB nodes for ~200\u202fGB of triple replicated capacity.\\n- **Data services** \u2013 CloudNativePG with scheduled S3-compatible off-site backups and Redis Sentinel (Bitnami legacy images) for stateful workloads.\\n- **App enablement** \u2013 Harbor registry, ArgoCD GitOps, and ready-to-use Helm values for common building blocks.\\n- **Security + secrets** \u2013 OpenBao as the source of truth with ExternalSecrets syncing into the cluster, plus documented ingress, TLS, and IP allowlist patterns.\\n- **Ops readiness** \u2013 Step-by-step guides for monitoring, logging, disaster recovery, and everyday utilities, all pinned to tested tool versions for reproducibility.\\n\\n## Why it matters\\n\\nManaged Kubernetes is fantastic, but it quickly eats into the budget of bootstrapped startups. Nursery shows that you can own the stack end-to-end, keep costs predictable, and still follow best practices for backups, observability, and multi-environment automation.\\n\\n## Dive in\\n\\n- Start with the [introduction](/) for motivation, audience, and cluster specs.\\n- Follow the [development environment](/development-environment/) and [getting started](/getting-started/) guides to mirror our toolchain.\\n- Explore the service deep dives (CNPG, Redis, Harbor, ArgoCD, storage, secrets, DR, etc.) in documentation and keep an eye on the [roadmap](/roadmap) for what is coming next.\\n\\nQuestions, ideas, or battle stories from your own clusters are very welcome \u2014 open an issue or start a discussion so we can keep improving the stack together."}]}}')}}]);
